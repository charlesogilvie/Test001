## Apache 2 Install ##

Trying different (newer) version. Package and dependencies found here: 
http://www.perzl.org/aix/index.php?n=Main.Apache

downloading to ~/cogilvie/pkgs/apache-2

It has many dependencies:
error: failed dependencies:
        apr-util >= 1.3.10-3 is needed by httpd-2.4.10-1
        apr-util-ldap >= 1.3.10-3 is needed by httpd-2.4.10-1

Getting dependencies:
apr-util
apr-util-ldap -> needs
openldap
db4 -> problems:

bash-4.3# rpm -hUv db4-4.7.25-2.aix5.1.ppc.rpm 
file /opt/freeware/lib/libdb-4.so from install of db4-4.7.25-2 conflicts with file from package db-4.8.24-4
file /opt/freeware/lib/libdb.a from install of db4-4.7.25-2 conflicts with file from package db-4.8.24-4
file /opt/freeware/lib/libdb.so from install of db4-4.7.25-2 conflicts with file from package db-4.8.24-4
file /opt/freeware/lib/libdb-4.a from install of db4-4.7.25-2 conflicts with file from package db-4.8.24-4

So - using the --replacefiles option. If all is broken later, uninstall both packages and re-install the original from batch2 which is db-4.8.24-4

httpd-2.4.10-1.aix5.1.ppc.rpm works at this point, however no ssl / port 443 support is in the package. Adding mod-ssl package.

Start error:
bash-4.3# /opt/freeware/sbin/apachectl start
AH00526: Syntax error on line 78 of /opt/freeware/etc/httpd/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf:
SSLSessionCache: 'shmcb' session cache not supported (known names: ). Maybe you need to load the appropriate socache module (mod_socache_shmcb?).

vi /opt/freeware/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
uncomment line 94
LoadModule socache_shmcb_module /opt/freeware/lib/httpd/modules/mod_socache_shmcb.so
/opt/freeware/sbin/apachectl start

Works on port 80 and 443

Now to figure out of my replacing db lib files will break everythingâ€¦
rpm -e --nodeps db4
Removing  db4-4.7.25-2 causes apache to fail to start:
Dependent module libdb-4.7.so could not be loaded.
So we need that file:
bash-4.3# find / -name libdb-4.7.so -print
/opt/freeware/lib/libdb-4.7.so    (Saved to libdb-4.7.so.keep)
/opt/freeware/lib64/libdb-4.7.so    (Saved to libdb-4.7.so.keep)
/usr/lib/libdb-4.7.so  libdb-4.7.so -> ../../opt/freeware/lib/libdb-4.7.so
/usr/lib64/libdb-4.7.so  libdb-4.7.so -> ../../opt/freeware/lib64/libdb-4.7.so
Remove db4-4.7.25-2 again after saving needed files.
mv /opt/freeware/lib/libdb-4.7.so.keep /opt/freeware/lib/libdb-4.7.so
mv /opt/freeware/lib64/libdb-4.7.so.keep /opt/freeware/lib64/libdb-4.7.so
ln -s /opt/freeware/lib/libdb-4.7.so /usr/lib/libdb-4.7.so
ln -s /opt/freeware/lib64/libdb-4.7.so /usr/lib64/libdb-4.7.so
RESULT: apache starts and db4-4.7.25-2 is not installed
Remove db-4.8.24-4 and re-install to get back --replacefiles option files
rpm -e --nodeps db
Test apache without db-4.8.24-4: WORKS
Reinstall db-4.8.24-4: rpm -hUv db-4.8.24-4.aix6.1.ppc.rpm
Test apache with db-4.8.24-4: WORKS
FYI: db-4.8.24-4 was needed by krb5, and python
